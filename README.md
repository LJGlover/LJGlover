### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I'm Leon Glover!


<!--
**LJGlover/LJGlover** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I spent the first half of my career in international education teaching students how to speak English and businesspeople how to do use English in their company. I was fortunate to travel to many places while doing this. However, five years ago I decided to give up after having achieved everything I set out to in that industry and I felt like a change. So I learned how to train dogs and spent a few years doing that. When the COVID situation happened I thought that was a good time to retrain and chose to follow my life-long passion of technology. My chosen area was Cloud Computing and am currently following the AWS re/Start programme as well as teaching myself Azure and a few other related things. I'm currently looking for my first Cloud position in the UK, Europe, or further afield.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting Cloud certifications while looking for an entry-level Cloud role.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS, Azure, and DevOps.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning and using Python programming.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you'd like to know, reach out if you know of any entry-level roles available, and feel free to message me if you're open to chatting about life in the tech Cloud!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: message me here on GitHub and I'll get back to you ASAP.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to work as a dog trainer - so if you'd like to talk dogs, I'm always up for that too!
