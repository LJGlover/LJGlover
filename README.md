### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I'm Leon Glover!

I spent the first half of my career in international education teaching students how to speak English and businesspeople how to do use English in their professional and personal lives. I was fortunate to travel to many places around the world while doing this. However, in 2016 I decided to give up after having achieved everything I set out to in that industry and I felt like a change. When the COVID situation happened I thought that was a good time to retrain and chose to follow my life-long passion of technology. My chosen area was Cloud Computing and I completed the AWS re/Start programme and passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. Since then I have achieved qualifications in Azure and SQL as well as the AWS Solutions Architect Associate qualification and am always looking to learn new technolgies and improve my knowledge and ability in technologies I already know. I'm currently pursuing my interests in coding with a view to finding work creating apps for the Apple ecosystem.
